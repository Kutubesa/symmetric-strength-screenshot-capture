# symmetric-strength-screenshot-capture
Creates a pop-up dialog on symmetricstrength.com with elements aligned on screen so you can take a screenshot easily with all the information about your strength stats.


How to use:  
Install greasemonkey (firefox) or tampermonkey (chromium browsers) extension.  
Create new script, paste the code from screenshot-script.js and save.  
On symmetricstrength.com enter stats, click 'Analyze Strength' and then click Prepare For Archiving button which was added by script.  


If you're using firefox, click ctrl+shif+s for screenshot. It allows selecting the html element, so you get the same resolution screenshot every time if you always log the same lifts.  
Script is not perfect, made for 1080p, good for logging 5 lifts, can fit up to 7 lifts in the window using full screen mode. Possible to fit more with a different resolution or zooming out.
